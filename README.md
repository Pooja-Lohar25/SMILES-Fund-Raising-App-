A web application which is a free learning platform for users to learn and donate to raise funds for charity.

All of us are well aware of the current situation around the globe. The pandemic has engulfed everyone who has come its way. People have been and are trying hard to fight against the deadly disease. 
Beside all this we have observed another set of people who are utilizing their time in learning and sharpening up their skills. Smiles will act as a linkage between the two. And will provide benefits to both. Besides linking it helps those who are facing issues in raising and collecting funds. 

On one hand people who are in need of money are being helped by our application on the other hand the volunteers who are the actual users of our application will also be benefitted as they will be <b>learning</b> about their favourite subjects by enrolling in any course they need and will raise funds by qualifying quizzes.

There are three prime obejctives that the application would achieve :<br>
- <b>Charity </b>
- <b>Learning </b>
- <b>Marketing</b>

People needing <b>financial</b> help will get the charity amount. <br>
The source of money would be the sponsors.  In return the application would help them in the <b>marketing</b> of their business.
